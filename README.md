AN VIRUS I MADE
its supposed to be a leaked version of notepad 12
for whoever that cares about notepad leaking
but yeah, this is a malware and a virus and it will mess around with youre pc
maybe run it in a vm to see what it does
run virus with run as admin

Normal = explorer killed - internet will be destroyed - Will Open In Startup - Annoying VBS Scripts (scroll for removal)

Dangerous = windows folder will be deleted - explorer killed - internet will be destroyed - Will Open In Startup - Annoying VBS Scripts (scroll for removal)

Safe: explorer killed - internet will be destroyed - Annoying VBS Scripts (scroll for removal)

SUPER Safe: Annoying VBS Scripts

they are some hidden files in the folder

dont change the location of any files

if you change the location it wont work

all the files should be in this folder the way they are

i dont know "dangerous/notepad.cmd" will delete System32,syswow64 and the boot folders



for deleting the normal version
1-close the cmd box

2-press ctrl alt delete and open task manager

3-click on run new task

4-in run box, type this: explorer.exe (you know what it does)

5-win+r

6-in run box, type this: taskkill /im wscript.exe (this work deletes the message boxes)

7-win+r

8-in run box, type this: ipconfig /renew (this restores the internet)

9-go to the this virus folder\remove

10-open shellrestore.reg

11-open shellfakedelete.cmd

done



for deleting the safe version

1- do steps 1-8 in the normal removal

done


for deleting the SUPER Safe version

1- do steps 1 and 6

done


for deleteing the dangerous version

1-repair windows using a windows installler disk

2- after booting back to the windows do the same things like the normal removal

done


these removals arent tested to work so again, dont run this on youre actual pc, maybe a vm but the normal, safe, and super safe versions are kinda easy to delete
if you dont want a lot of work, the safe version ill do,
