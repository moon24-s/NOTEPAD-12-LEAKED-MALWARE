AN VIRUS I MADE
its supposed to be a leaked version of notepad 12
for whoever that cares about notepad leaking
but yeah, this is a malware and a virus and it will mess around with youre pc
maybe run it in a vm to see what it does
run virus with run as admin

notepad.cmd = explorer killed - internet will be destroyed (removal.txt for removing the safe/normal version)

dangerous/notepad.cmd = system32 and syswow64 and boot folders be deleted - explorer killed - internet will be destroyed


they are some hidden files in the folder

dont change the location of any files

if you change the location it wont work

all the files should be in this folder the way they are



i dont know "dangerous/notepad.cmd" will delete System32,syswow64 and boot folders (if it didnt work the removal.txt instrutions will remove this version too)



made with batch and Visual Basic Script
