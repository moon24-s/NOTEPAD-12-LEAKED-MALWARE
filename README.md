AN VIRUS I MADE
its supposed to be a leaked version of notepad 12
for whoever that cares about notepad leaking
but yeah, this is a malware and a virus and it will mess around with youre pc
maybe run it in a vm to see what it does
run virus with run as admin

notepad.cmd = explorer killed - internet will be destroyed (scroll for removal)

dangerous/notepad.cmd = system32 and syswow64 and boot folders be deleted - explorer killed - internet will be destroyed


they are some hidden files in the folder

dont change the location of any files

if you change the location it wont work

all the files should be in this folder the way they are

i dont know "dangerous/notepad.cmd" will delete System32,syswow64 and the boot folders



for deleting the safe version
1-close the cmd box

2-press ctrl alt delete and open task manager

3-click on run new task

4-in run box, type this: explorer.exe (you know what it does)

5-win+r

6-in run box, type this: taskkill /im wscript.exe (this work deletes the message boxes)

7-win+r

8-in run box, type this: ipconfig /renew (this restores the internet)

9-go to the this virus folder\remove

10-open shellrestore.reg

11-open shellfakedelete.cmd

done


for deleteing the dangerous version

1-repair windows using a windows installler disk (if it made the windows unbootable)

2- after booting back to the windows do the same things like the safe removal

these removals arent tested to work so again, dont run this on youre actual pc, maybe a vm
