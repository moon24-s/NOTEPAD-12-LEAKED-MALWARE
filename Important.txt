sorry if some of the words i write are wrong



run virus with run as admin



notepad.cmd = explorer killed - internet will be destroyed (removal.txt for removing the safe/normal version)

dangerous/notepad.cmd = system32 and syswow64 and boot folders be deleted - explorer killed - internet will be destroyed


they are some hidden files in this folder

dont change the location of any files

if you change the location it wont work

all the files should be in this folder the way they are



i dont know "dangerous/notepad.cmd" will delete System32,syswow64 and boot folders (if it didnt work the removal.txt instrutions will remove this version too)



made with batch and Visual Basic Script
